### FAQ
- how did I export the iOS shortcut to a file ?
  - I followed [this article's instructions](https://www.addictivetips.com/ios/save-iphone-shortcut-offline/).
  - Although it didn't work at first, I **removed** the last instruction and added one that saved the Resulting element to a file.
  - [here is my modified version of the shortcut exporter](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/cde4969f06b14a47ab6a6df46d404326)
  - *note: to import shortcuts you **must first** move them to your iCloud Drive. You won't be able to import them from anywhere else.*
